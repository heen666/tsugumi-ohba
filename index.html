            As a child, I often wandered the streets. When I reached the T-junction I turned right and at the next
            intersection I turned left. Thus, alternating right and left turns, I climbed quite far from home. When the
            intersections ended, I turned around and walked back. But on the way back I encountered only side streets -
            and not a single intersection. “What a mystery... What kind of tricks?” - I thought. I returned home, asking
            passers-by for directions. This is the kind of stupid thing I did as a child.

        <p>
            Ohba's real identity is a closely guarded secret. Ohba said they never thought of becoming a manga creator,
            expecting the <i>Death Note </i>pilot to be passed on by Weekly Shōnen Jump. They have since cited Shotaro
            Ishinomori, Fujiko Fujio, and Fujio Akatsuka as manga creators by whom they are heavily inspired. Despite
            being an author, Ohba does not read much, instead they watch a lot of movies, being especially fond of those
            by Akira Kurosawa and Charlie Chaplin. They cited comedy as their favorite genre, and prefer Japanese films
            to American ones. The author described themselves as a "clean freak" and usually cleans once a day. Ohba is
            fond of art lithographs, collects teacups, and develops manga plots while holding their knees on a chair,
            the last being similar to a habit of L, one of the main characters of <i>Death Note</i>.
